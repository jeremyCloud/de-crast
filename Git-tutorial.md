## Basic Git Workflow

Git is a distributed version control software that was originally designed to 
handle large scale distributed software projects like the Linux kernel. If you
are farmiliar with Apple computers, git acts similar to TimeMachine on your mac.
It allows the developer to save previous states of a project, and the ability to
revert to any one of these states at will. The main idea is instead of panicing
when your new function breaks your program you just go back to the last working 
state and fix your problem from there. 

Git is a very powerful tool, and the above description does not begin to touch
all of the features git has to offer. The truth of the matter is most of the 
time you will only use **$(some number)** main commands. Those commands are the ones
I will cover here.

Git is actually just a commandline tool, but the website [github][1] has made a
fantastic ecosystem around this tool. I will be framing this tutorial around 
the idea that you are using [github][1] to host your project. In that, I will 
also go into some of the features [github][1] provides for project management.
I will also assume you already have a working [github][1] account up and 
running. So without further adieu, let's get started.


*Here's the story.*

you just started the hot new task manager app and you decided to host it on 
[github][1]. You already created the repo and invited all your teammates as 
collaberators. Now it's time to get that repo on your computer and start 
working.
